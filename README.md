1) Addition: add input signals (any number) and display the resulting signal.
2) Subtraction: subtract input signals and display the resulting signal.
3) Multiplication: multiply a signal by a constant value to amplify or reduce the signal amplitude. (If constant equals -1, then signal will be inverted)
4) Squaring: squaring a signal and displaying the resulting signal.
5) Shifting: add to the signal a (+ve) or (-ve) constant.
6) Accumulation of input signal.
